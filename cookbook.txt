Spicy Lime Avocado Soup

Ingredients
----------------------------------
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large white onion, chopped, divided
3 limes, juiced
1 cup chopped cilantro, divided
2 jalapeno peppers, halved and thinly sliced

Ladle soup into 4 bowls. Top with remaining 1/2 onion, 1/2 cup cilantro, avocado, and queso fresco.
